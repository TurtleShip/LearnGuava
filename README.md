# Learn Guava

This artifact is a collection of tests for Guava 16.0 library.

I wrote the tests for my own references.

I tend to forget things, and reading through units tests helps me remember what I used to know. Plus, writing unit tests for classes help me better understand the classes I test.

I read through [Getting started with Google Guava](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-started-Google-Guava-Bejeck-ebook/dp/B00EJIZRG6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398319339&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+started+with+guava) to get started with Guava. If you see any similarity between my tests and example codes from the book, my tests probably modeled after examples from the book.
